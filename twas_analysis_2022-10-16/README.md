# Identify asthma risk genes with combination of colocalization and TWAS using new gwas data



We first downloaded the new gwas data for asthma diseases in the folder `./gwas_asthma_GBMI/` from [the Global Biobank Meta-analyses Initiative (GBMI)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666979X22001653?via%3Dihub), including three ancestry population summary data, African, European and all the populations.

The folder `analysis2` for new gwas data.
